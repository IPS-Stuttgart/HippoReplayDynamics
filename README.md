# HippoReplayIMM

`hipporeplayimm` is a standalone Python package for benchmarking motion-model and
interacting-multiple-model (IMM) interpretations of hippocampal replay in the
Pfeiffer/Foster open-field dataset.

The raw dataset is expected to remain outside the repository, for example:

```powershell
hipporeplayimm inspect D:\Uni-Data\DataSetFromPfeifferFoster
hipporeplayimm benchmark D:\Uni-Data\DataSetFromPfeifferFoster --max-events 25 --output results
hipporeplayimm decode-event D:\Uni-Data\DataSetFromPfeifferFoster --session Rat1/Open1 --event-id 0
```

The first implementation focuses on the eight `Rat1-4/Open1-2` sessions. It
fits occupancy-normalized Poisson place-field encoders from movement periods,
scores replay events with several motion priors, and reports held-out spike log
predictive density as the primary metric.

## Included Models

- `random`: independent uniform latent position at every time bin.
- `stationary`: one constant latent position throughout the event.
- `diffusion`: first-order Brownian/random-walk dynamics; the benchmark uses
  candidate-pruned scoring for speed, while `DiffusionModel` remains available
  for exact small-grid checks.
- `momentum`: candidate-pruned second-order dynamics with velocity persistence.
- `imm`: candidate-pruned switching model over stationary, diffusion, momentum,
  and jump/fragmented modes.

The candidate-pruned models use the same candidate sets for train and joint
likelihoods during held-out scoring, so `log p(train, test) - log p(train)` is
well-defined under the same approximate state support.
